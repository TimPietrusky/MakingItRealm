I'm a generalist (who sometimes would like to get specialized then gets bored, and tries something entirely new).
I'm mostly driven by aesthetics. My creations usually have to do with visuals or music. I'm fascinated by generative art. Sometimes I take photos, sometimes I create by coding, and I have tons of music-related gear (mostly sampler/sequencer combos) next to my desk.
