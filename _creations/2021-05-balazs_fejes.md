I find the Cantonese way of serving chicken, head proudly displayed on the plate, a great reality check. But going to the seafood market is a level-up. I get to see my dinner swimming, crawling, blinking right back at me. Then we take these sea monsters, flopping in a plastic bag, right across the road, to our favourite restaurant, where it becomes heavenly food. I am doing my job in this circle of life, and I am grateful.
