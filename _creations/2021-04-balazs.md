I’ve noticed a fascination with laundry in the photos of my recent photo walks. I’m aware that it’s a bit voyeuristic! I think these hanging clothes tell their stories so well...The number of them, the state they are in, are they for a family, or just for a single person? Sometimes a particular color scheme across a clothesline makes me cheerful or sad. I listen to the stories and make the snap.
