I tried to recreate a photo I made of Aniko and our dog, [Alka](https://www.instagram.com/alkalandor/), in an underground exit. Realism is very hard, but I feel like I'm getting there. Also, I'm using a render farm now because my old laptop almost caught fire and I don't want to sell my kidney for a GPU.
