During [S01E04 (Part 2) of Audio Reactive Visuals](https://youtu.be/_tGAd_Vl-4w) (a [live stream that is run by NERDDISCO every Sunday](https://twitch.tv/nerddisco)), the GLSL shader "The High Priestess" from [Pixel Spirit](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.github.io/PixelSpiritDeck/) was transformed into an audio reactive visual. The showcased work shows the result from that episode called ["The High Priestess Society"](https://github.com/NERDDISCO/AudioReactiveVisuals/tree/main/S01/E04) combined with music from [Pitch Black](https://soundcloud.com/pitchblacknz/pitch-black-lost-in-bird-soul-live-at-ozora-17) as a rendered static image. The shape is directly connected with the audio data (FFT) of that moment in time when the image was taken.
