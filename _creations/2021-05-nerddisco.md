During [S01E04 (Part 2) of Audio Reactive Visuals](https://youtu.be/_tGAd_Vl-4w) (a [live stream that is run by NERDDISCO every Sunday](https://twitch.tv/nerddisco)), the GLSL shader "The High Priestess" from [Pixel Spirit](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.github.io/PixelSpiritDeck/) was transformed into an audio reactive visual, which resulted in ["The High Priestess Society"](https://github.com/NERDDISCO/AudioReactiveVisuals/blob/main/S01/E04/The_High_Priestess_Society.frag). This was combined with [music from Pitch Black](https://soundcloud.com/pitchblacknz/pitch-black-lost-in-bird-soul-live-at-ozora-17) inside of [glslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer) where the audio data ([FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)) has direct influence on the shape of the shader. The showcased static image was extracted from a recording of the whole process.
